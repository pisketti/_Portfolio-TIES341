# My first week of studying functional programming with Haskell..

I can honestly tell that I'm a Haskell beginner. No prior experience to this course.

Yes this is not a course for beginners but I'm going to take apart, none the less.

## Where I started

Here it is. http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters

I've now read sections from 1 to 4.

I use Ubuntu 12.04 and typed `sudo apt-get install ghc6 ghc6-prof ghc6-doc` as a first command to my shell.

Then it says:
```
enyone@rnet6:~$ ghci
GHCi, version 7.4.1: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Loading package ghc-prim ... linking ... done.
Loading package integer-gmp ... linking ... done.
Loading package base ... linking ... done.
Prelude> 
```

The book told me to type:
```
Prelude> :set prompt "ghci> "
ghci> 
```

I belive it is because `ghci>` is more self-explanatory as a prompt than `Prelude>` is.

Yay! Now it can be used as a calculator as well!
```
ghci> 1+2
3
```

I hope this is not the only case when to use Haskell for anything.
